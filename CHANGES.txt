# CHANGELOG #

## Version 1.3.0, 2018-03-23 ##

- SoMeWeTa has now XML support. To tag an XML file, use the option
  -x/--xml. It is assumed that each XML tag is on a separate line.
- The implementation of the beam search algorithm has been slightly
  improved.

## Version 1.2.0, 2018-02-23 ##

It is now possible to use the option --ignore-tag to specify a tag
that will not be learned during training and that will be ignored
during evaluation. Use case: Partially annotated data that use a
pseudo-tag for tokens without annotation.

## Version 1.1.2, 2017-10-27 ##

Bugfix: Using the --parallel option does no longer change the order of
the sentences.

## Version 1.1.1, 2017-10-25 ##

This version fixes a bug that made it impossible to use the --parallel
option when reading from STDIN.

## Version 1.1.0, 2017-10-24 ##

- Bugfix: Removed trailing space from last tag in sentence.
- The new option --parallel makes it possible to use a pool of worker
  processes to speed up tagging.
- We also print a log message that indicates tagging speed.

## Version 1.0.0, 2017-09-15 ##

First release.
